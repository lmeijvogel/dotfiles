# History search searches the history for commands
# starting with anything preceding the cursor, so
# if the prompt looks like this (_ is the cursor)
# $ cd .s_
#
# And I do a history search, I can cycle though all
# previously entered commands that start with "cd .s",
# e.g. "cd .ssh", "cd .shotwell", "cd .shutter"
#
# With forward-char and backward-char, I move the cursor
# left or right, to match more or less specific strings.

# Arrow up
